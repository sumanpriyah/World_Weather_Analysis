# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the World_Weather_Analysis:
In this project we need to deliver below deliverables using API skills.Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest
citties, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the data through API calls.
Exported and read the CSV files. We helped Jack by creating PlanMyTrip app which can help Beta user to filter the data to identify potential travel 
destinations and nearby hotels.It will help to create travel route between the citites. The Marker layer map can help users with the important information
as added in the info box template.

 
 ### Deliverables


1) Retrieve Weather Data
2) Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3) Create a Travel Itinerary Map


### Software Used
python- 3.9.7 , conda 4.10.3, jupyter 1.0.0, Google maps platform 

## Results:

### Retrieve Weather Data
Retrieve the below data through API calls and adding data to DataFrame. This will help to find user near by hotels and current weather conditions in given
latitudes and longitudes.
 
### Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Added input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
Showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

### Create a Travel Itinerary Map

Added the feature on the app that allows customers to search for locations they want to travel based on their temperature preferences.
Used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel 
destinations. Created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
